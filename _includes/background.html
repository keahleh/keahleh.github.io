    <!-- <p>
      I'm a computer science &amp; business student under Nanyang Technological University's 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/rep/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Renaissance Engineering Programme</a>.

      More about myself, I love solving math problems and I probably spend too much time on puzzle games. 
      The systematic and logical approach of identifying patterns and finding solutions in these games and problems 
      is incredibly satisfying, and this is also why coding and software engineering appeals to me. 
      I love learning more about these and I'm always open to <strong>learning opportunities, projects and internships.</strong>

      <strong>If you don't find me in front of a computer screen</strong>, it would mean that I'm probably in the gym, cheerleading, or 
      making myself a nice cup of coffee.

      Management University.

      I am curious about how people and society interacts with each other. Hence, I pursued a 
      major in Psychology to study humans' feelings, thoughts and behaviours in social situations. 
      In addition, I am always on social media platforms and started to gain interest in how businesses 
      and influencers leverage on these platforms to expand brand awareness. I love to gain deeper 
      insights on these aspects and I am always open to learning new cultures, opportunities and 
      internships. I aspire to apply what I have learnt in my academics to businesses and develop
      holistically as an individual.
